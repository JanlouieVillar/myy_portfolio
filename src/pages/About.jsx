        <p>
          Hi, I’m <span className="text-gray-200 font-medium">Jan-Louie Villar</span>, 
          an aspiring Web Developer with a strong interest in building modern,
          responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy turning ideas
          and designs into functional products using clean and maintainable code.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into web development started with curiosity about how
          websites work behind the scenes. Over time, that curiosity grew into
          hands-on experience building projects with <span className="text-gray-200">HTML</span>,{" "}
          <span className="text-gray-200">CSS</span>,{" "}
          <span className="text-gray-200">JavaScript</span>,{" "}
          <span className="text-gray-200">React</span>, and{" "}
          <span className="text-gray-200">Tailwind CSS</span>. I focus on creating
          interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive
          and accessible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with UI ideas, and
          continuously improving my skills through personal projects and
          practice. I’m especially interested in front-end development, where
          design and logic come together to create meaningful user experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m currently looking for opportunities to grow as a developer,
          collaborate with others, and contribute to real-world projects where
          I can continue learning while delivering value. I’m motivated,
          detail-oriented, and always open to feedback as a way to improve.
